# Canvas Express

Canvas Express is a free as in freedom, minimalist and fast-paced, boxing-themed fighting game. Matches consist of a single 30-second round that probably won't event last as long---three of four well placed punches will send your opponent to the canvas!

You can download the game from the (
https://github.com/ramirobasile/canvas-express/releases)[releases section].

This game runs using LÖVE 2D. Once you install LÖVE 2D from your distribution's repository or from their (https://love2d.org/)[website], you should be able to execute `canvas-express.love` to get the game running.

Note: This repository only contains the game's releases, as I'm not using any VCS.
