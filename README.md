# Canvas Express

Canvas Express is a free as in freedom, minimalist and fast-paced, boxing-themed fighting game. Matches consist of a single 30-second round that probably won't event last as long---three of four well placed punches will send your opponent to the canvas!

You can download the game from the releases section.

This game runs using LÖVE 2D. Once you install LÖVE 2D from your distribution's repository or from their website, you should be able to execute `canvas-express.love` to get the game running.

Note: This repository only contains the game's releases, as I'm not using any VCS.

If you need help or have any other questions I invite you to shoot me an e-mail!
