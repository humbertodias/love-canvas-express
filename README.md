# Canvas Express

Note: This repository only contains the game's releases, as I'm not using any VCS.

Canvas Express is a free as in freedom, minimalist and fast-paced, boxing-themed fighting game. Matches consist of a single 30-second round that probably won't event last as long---three of four well placed punches will send your opponent to the canvas!

## Running the game and troubleshooting

Download the game from the releases section:

[Canvas Express releases](https://github.com/ramirobasile/canvas-express/releases)

This game runs using LÖVE. You can get LÖVE from your distribution's repository or from their website. Once you have it installed, you should be able to execute `canvas-express.love` to get the game running.
